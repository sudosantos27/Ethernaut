/** This is the typical reentrancy attack. The vulnerability here is in the withdraw function. It updates the balance 

after it transfers the money. So what we have to do is create a contract that deposits money, then withdraws and when 

it receives the ethers, the fallback function should execute the withdraw function again and again. */
