/** To beat this level you need to know how inheritance works. In this code, we import ERC20 from openzeppelin and inherit 

the contract. When we do that, all the functions from the inherited contracts are now in our contract. It does not matter 

itâ€™s not written. So knowing this, we can use a function from ERC20.sol called transferFrom, that allow us to transfer the 

tokens form our address to another one. But first, we need to see how this function works. Looking at ERC20.sol code, we see 

that we need to approve a spender to send a token.

First we can check if the player is allowed to transfer token: Number(await contract.allowance(player, player))

This returns zero, meaning that the spender is allowed to spend 0 tokens.

To allow the player to send tokens: await contract.approve(player, "1000000000000000000000000")

Now we can transfer: await contract.transferFrom(player, "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001", "1000000000000000000000000") */
